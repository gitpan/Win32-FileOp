Win32::FileOp

Many file related functions for Windows:
	Copy, move, delete and recycle files with confirmation and progress dialogs
	Open, SaveAs and BrowseForFolder dialogs
	NTFS Compression
	INI files
	Drive mapping and substitution
	Recent documents list modification

uses Data::Lazy - available from CPAN
 and Win32::AbsPath - available from http://Jenda.Krynicky.cz
  (I plan to move over to File::Spec one day. )
